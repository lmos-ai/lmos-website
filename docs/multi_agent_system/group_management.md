# Group Management

## Problem statement

The architecture should support the creation, management, and dissolution of agent groups, fostering enhanced collaboration, coordination, and trust among agents within the system. Group management offers several key advantages:

* **Security & Trust:** Group management enforces trust relationships, ensuring that only trustworthy agents can join a group. This is crucial for safeguarding sensitive data and ensuring that only trusted agents are allowed to collaborate within the group.
* **Tenant Isolation**: Groups can be formed for different tenants, ensuring that each tenant has access to a unique set of agents. This isolation allows for customized agent configurations tailored to the specific needs of each tenant.
  
* **Channel Isolation**: Within a single tenant, multiple groups can be created for various use cases. For instance, a chatbot integrated into a web application might use a different set of agents than a chatbot connected to a hotline. Every channel could be configured as a dedicated group.

* **Adaptive Routing**: The system can implement adaptive routing, allowing agents to dynamically join or leave groups as needed. This ensures that the most capable agents are available for specific tasks or contexts.

* **Task Distribution**: Complex tasks often require collaboration between specialized agents. Group management enables the distribution of tasks across a trusted group of agents. 

* **Channel-Aware Behavior**: Agents can adapt their behavior based on the configuration of their current group, enhancing their ability to operate effectively within different contexts.
