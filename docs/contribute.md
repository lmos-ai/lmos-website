# How to contribute

As we work through the transition of LMOS repositories within Deutsche Telekom to the open-source community, many opportunities for contribution are already available. During this transition, we are actively encouraging developers to get involved in the development of LMOS and its related projects.

We aim to create a supportive environment for developers, offering demos, videos and guidance as you learn about LMOS and contribute to its growth. Whether you're skilled in coding, documentation, design, project management, or organizing community events, there’s valuable work to be done.

With the launch of LMOS as an open-source project, we want to established GitHub discussions as a central hub for engaging with the community and the LMOS developers.

We believe that the open-source community is vital to the success of LMOS. That’s why we are committed to fostering strong community involvement from day one. An essential step in this process is ensuring that community members have a voice in the development of LMOS. We want to ensure that everyone—regardless of their background or expertise—feels empowered to contribute.

We're here to help you on your journey with LMOS!
