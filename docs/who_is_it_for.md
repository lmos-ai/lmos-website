# Who’s it for?



LMOS is for anyone who has started with a single AI agent and is now looking to integrate multiple agents into one seamless, unified system. This includes developers who have created individual AI agents and now want to bring them together, companies that need to connect AI agents built by different departments, or even multiple organizations working in collaboration.

For example, consider a company that initially created a customer service chatbot to handle basic inquiries. As the company grows, it develops specialized AI agents to handle different areas of customer interaction, such as frequently asked questions, billing inquiries, order-related issues, sales offers, technical support, and general knowledge queries. While these agents are developed independently to focus on their specific tasks, they need to work together seamlessly to ensure a smooth and efficient customer experience. With LMOS, all these agents, whether created by different teams in different languages or even different companies, can be integrated into a single platform. They can share data, collaborate on tasks, and communicate with each other, making the entire system more efficient, flexible, and scalable.

LMOS makes it easy to connect these diverse agents, allowing organizations to manage them together as a single unit, regardless of the tools, frameworks, or languages used to build each one. Whether you're working on a small-scale project or a large enterprise-level deployment, LMOS helps you build a connected, interoperable network of intelligent agents that can grow and evolve alongside your needs.
