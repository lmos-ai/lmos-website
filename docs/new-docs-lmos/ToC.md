### 1. **Introduction**
   - Overview of LMOS
   - Enterprise Multi Agent Use cases Requirements & Considerations 
   - Comparison with Existing Agent Frameworks (e.g., Swarm)
       Grouped into 3. 
       1. Single Agent Development
       2. Agent Routing
       3. Agent lifeclye Management 

### 2. **Getting Started**
   - System Requirements
   - Installation Guide
   - Quick Start: Setting Up Your First Agent
   - Example: Deploying a Simple Customer Support Agent
   - Deploying another Agent that joins the system

### 3. **Core Concepts** 
   - Multi Agents and LMOS Agent Development Lifecycle
   - Understanding LMOS DSL & Single Agent Development Democraotzation ( allows hard concerns to be handled elsewhere eg libs for anonymizer and a scaffloding template for an agent within an enteprise, hard concerns of agent lifecycle management and routing is taken care elsehwere ) 
   - We will dive into Single Agen Development features in a nutshell

### 1. **Agent Development**
   - Single Agent Development Best Practices
   - Advanced DSL Features for Agent Configuration ( Guradrails , Filters )
   - Defining Agent Capabilities and Roles ( seed file & other::  as examples for any framework , eg llama and one with Arc)
   - Practical Example: Billing Agent with Sensitive Data Handling

### 2. **Multi Agent Automatic Routing and Orchestration**
   - Overview of LMOS Multi Dimensional Routing Engine
   - Hybrid Routing Strategy and Vector-Based Matching
   - Agent Collaboration and Handoffs
   - Example: Multi-Agent System with Dynamic Routing

### 3. **Agent Lifecylce management: Deplyoments & Maintenance **
   - Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) for LMOS Agents
   - Multi tenancy and Multi Channel exampleÂ´
   - Rollout Strategies 
   - Managing and Updating Agents in Production
   - Troubleshooting Common Issues in Large-Scale Deployments
   - Documentation and Versioning Strategies for Agents
