# Open Agent Manifesto

Organizations across sectors are increasingly recognizing the necessity of intelligent agent ecosystems. These ecosystems must evolve to meet the user demands of today's rapidly changing technological landscape.

Traditionally, intelligent agents operated within closed systems with limited adaptability. However, modern ecosystems require agents to seamlessly operate across diverse platforms, providing dynamic adaptability and user experiences.

We advocate for systems that prioritize four core principles: Openness, Interoperability, Security, and Transparency (OIST). Systems built upon these principles enable seamless integration across platforms, fostering collaboration and innovation. They prioritize transparent operations, granting users visibility into agent behavior and decision-making processes. Moreover, they uphold accountability, ensuring agents adhere to ethical standards and safeguard user trust.
Intelligent agent ecosystems aligned with the OIST Principles offer users a trustworthy and dynamic experience, where new agents can seamlessly join and contribute to the ecosystem's growth and innovation.

**Openness:** Embrace open standards and protocols to foster collaboration, innovation, and accessibility within the intelligent agent ecosystem, over closed proprietary systems that hinder collaboration and innovation.

**Interoperability:** Ensure seamless communication and interaction between diverse intelligent agents, allowing them to work across platforms and ecosystems, over isolated systems or lock-ins that restrict interoperability and limit user choice.

**Transparency and Accountability:** Prioritize transparency in agent design, operation, and decision-making processes, promoting user trust and accountability for ethical behavior, over opaque systems that conceal operations and lack accountability.

**Data Privacy and Security:** Uphold robust security measures and privacy standards to protect sensitive data, ensuring user confidentiality and trustworthiness of intelligent agents, over insecure systems that compromise user privacy and expose data to unauthorized access.
